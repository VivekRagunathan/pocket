# Milk For The Cat

**Harold Monro**

When the tea is brought at five o'clock,
And all the neat curtains are drawn with care,
The little black cat with bright green eyes
Is suddenly purring there.

At first she pretends, having nothing to do,
She has come in merely to blink by the grate,
But, though tea may be late or the milk may be sour,
She is never late.

And presently her agate eyes
Take a soft large milky haze,
And her independent casual glance
Becomes a stiff, hard gaze.

Then she stamps her claws or lifts her ears,
Or twists her tail and begins to stir,
Till suddenly all her lithe body becomes
One breathing, trembling purr.

The children eat and wriggle and laugh;
The two old ladies stroke their silk:
But the cat is grown small and thin with desire,
Transformed to a creeping lust for milk.

The white saucer like some full moon descends
At last from the clouds of the table above;
She sighs and dreams and thrills and glows,
Transfigured with love.

She nestles over the shining rim,
Buries her chin in the creamy sea;
Her tail hangs loose; each drowsy paw
Is doubled under each bending knee.

A long, dim ecstasy holds her life;
Her world is an infinite shapeless white,
Till her tongue has curled the last holy drop,
Then she sinks back into the night,

Draws and dips her body to heap
Her sleepy nerves in the great arm-chair,
Lies defeated and buried deep
Three or four hours unconscious there.


NOTES:
A very well-known poem, and probably the most popular piece of work Monro has produced. The beauty lies in the detail and the empathetic observation. Not a great deal to say about form here, but this is one of those poems that you suddenly find yourself smiling about. And if you're a feline-fancier, you're probably purring by now. It has got that indescribable feeling of what the Teutons call gemutlichkeit, of which 'cosiness' is a hopelessly inadequate translation.

The Columbia Encyclopedia has this to say about Monro -

Harold Monro - 1879-1932, English poet, b. Belgium. In 1911 he founded the Poetry Review and the following year established the Poetry Bookshop, which became a refuge and intellectual center for poets. His Poetry and Drama (1913), a successor to the Poetry Review, was discontinued during World War I, but Monro reestablished it as Chapbook (1919?25). Both periodicals had great influence on the poetical work of the time. His own work, first published in 1906, includes Children of Love (1914) and Elm Angel (1930).
