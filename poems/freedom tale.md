# The Freedom Tale

```
Thus did India fall
To the powerful British call.

'They' had come to trade
But money-a-lot did our Indians paid.

For the goods in England
Raw materials were produced in our Motherland.

Many against 'them' had to rise
For they were winning prize after prize.

Gandhi, Nehru, Shastri, Bose, Bhagat and Patel
Fought and died to build the Indian freedom tale.

Divide and rule was 'their' basis
which caused many-a-crisis.

Long and long did our Indians suffer
while Jayakar and Sapru were a bloody buffer.

After years and years
Did our shouts fall on 'their' ears.

And 'they' with Gandhi a night
Settled the struggle - our freedom fight.

August 15, 1947 was the day of the freedom
After an year and two, we framed our Indian Kingdom.
