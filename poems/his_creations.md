# His Creations

God has made this world with beauty
    And to love it is our duty

God is Great
    And he marks our fate

God sends the soft breeze for freshness
    And sunlight for brightness

God gives us the life-giving rain
    Our prayers will never be in vain

We all are like the rainbow of the sky
    And on seeing us, HIS heart leaps up by and by

He blesses all of us
    And only He in this unreal world is pious

God is the father of all
    My soul is waiting for his call

God is the master of all
    And will not allow nature's downfall

Almighty He is
    And all these creations are HIS

In this world, only He is perfect
    And the creation of man is HIS only defect.
