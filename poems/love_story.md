# Love Story

Thus did I began to love her
    Whence I had seen her
And whence she became my dear
    .......and I love her.

Her thoughts soon began to pierce my heart
    She was filled in my every thought,
Every breadth, every sight and every part.
    She began to kill me by 'her' thoughts.

.....But when I hadn't seen her
    I began to cry and weep in me
I wasn't able to say my love;
    Till at last..........

Hoping to love, I went to her
    And said, "I have lost my heart in love....";
She smiled......,
    "...to you", said I.

My Hopes Of Love Began To Bloom.

And we began to love from then
    And loved for seconds, minutes and hours,
Days, weeks and fortnights.
    I became fancied in her eyes in these days.

To fulfill our lives,
    We blossomed our love.
And paired us in the bond of marriage,
    Hoping to live happily for many-an-age.
